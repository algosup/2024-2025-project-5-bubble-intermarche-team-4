## Architecture

### Application Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture, with each page (in Bubble) representing a page in the app.
All pages in the application are interconnected, ensuring seamless navigation.

#### Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    %% Main Flow
    subgraph MainFlow [Main Flow]
        A[Welcome]
        B[Home]
        C[Scan]
        D[Search Page]
    end

    %% Product Pages
    subgraph ProductPages [Product Pages]
        E[Mix & Match]
        F[Wine]
        G[Cheese]
        H[Meal]
        I[Product Page]
    end

    %% Connections
    A --> B
    B <--> C
    B <--> D
    B <--> E
    B <--> F
    B <--> G
    B <--> H

    C --> F
    C --> G

    D --> F
    D --> G
    D --> H
    D <--> I

    E <--> I
    F <--> I
    G <--> I

    I --> B
    
```

The Users arrive on the **Welcome** page, here they can choose their language (by default French) and then they are redirected to the **Home** page.
Once on the **Home** page, they have access to multiple features:

- **Scan**: Users can scan a product's barcode to get more information about it.
- **Search Page**: Users can search for a product by name or filter by type (wine, cheese, meal).
- **The Different Product Pages**: Users can access the different product pages (wine, cheese, meal) to explore the available products.
- **Mix & Match**: Users can explore the different combinations of wine, cheese and meal.

If the User wants more information on a specific product, he can click on it and he will be redirected onto the corresponding **Product Page**.

### Page Architecture

The application being built using Bubble.io, the pages are built following the Bubble.io conventions; as such, each page has a main group that encapsulates the entire page.
The main group contains the different sections of the page, which are further divided into groups and again into elements.
The page architecture is as follows:

```mermaid
graph TD
    %% Page Structure
    A[Page]
    B[Main Group]

    %% Section Groups
    C[Section Group]
    D[Section Group]
    E[Section Group]

    %% Object Groups
    F[Object Group]
    G[Object Group]
    H[Object Group]
    I[Object Group]
    J[Object Group]
    K[Object Group]
    L[Object Group]
    M[Object Group]
    N[Object Group]

    %% Elements
    O[Element]
    P[Element]
    Q[Element]
    R[Element]
    S[Element]
    T[Element]
    U[Element]
    V[Element]
    W[Element]

    %% Connections
    A --> B

    B --> C
    B --> D
    B --> E

    C --> F
    C --> G
    C --> H

    D --> I
    D --> J
    D --> K

    E --> L
    E --> M
    E --> N

    F --> O
    G --> P
    H --> Q
    I --> R
    J --> S
    K --> T
    L --> U
    M --> V
    N --> W
```

This page architecture clearly defines the hierarchy of the page, with the main group containing all the sections and objects.
Each section group contains multiple object groups, which in turn contain various elements.
The elements can be buttons, text, images, inputs, etc. This modular approach allows for easy maintenance and updates to the application.

#### Repeating Groups

In Bubble.io, repeating groups are used to display lists of items dynamically. Each repeating group contains a group that encapsulates the different sections and objects of the repeating group.

The structure is different for pages containing repeating groups: the repeating group is encapsulated in a group, and contains a group that contains the different sections and objects of the repeating group.

```mermaid

graph TD
    %% Repeating Group Structure
    A[Section Group]
    B[Encapsulating Group]
    C[Repeating Group]

    D[Section Group]

    E[Object Group]
    F[Object Group]
    G[Object Group]

    H[Element]
    I[Element]
    J[Element]

    %% Connections
    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    D --> F
    D --> G
    E --> H
    F --> I
    G --> J
    
```

> Note: In the case that the repeating group only contains one element(e.g. a text), their is no need to have a section group and an object group inside the reeating group.

### Database Design

The database contains infomation about wines, cheeses and meals; includings their names, origin and other relevant details.

The database contains the following files:

- **wines.json**: Specify the wines available in the store, including their ITM8, EAN, name, region, country, year, type, grape, price, rating, description(fr and en), image and indicating if the wine is a best seller,
- **cheeses.json**: Specify the cheeses available in the store, including their ITM8, EAN, name, region, country, type, milk, price, rating, description(fr and en), image and indicating if the cheese is a best seller,
- **meal.json**: Specify a selection of French meals that can be paired with wine and cheese, including their name, recipe, description(fr and en), image, a list of allergens and a list of wines and cheeses that they can be paired with,
- **Data - Wine and Cheese.xlsx**: A spreadsheet given by IntermarchÃ© containing the wines and cheeses available in the store, including their ITM8, EAN, name, prix de vente

> The database can be found in the [data](../../data/) folder.
> Some additional information about the database can be found in the [README](../../data/README.md) of the database.
