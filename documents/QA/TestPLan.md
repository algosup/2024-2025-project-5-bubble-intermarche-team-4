# Introduction

The purpose of this Test Plan is to ensure that the Bubble-based application is fully functional, stable, and free of defects before delivery to the client.
By defining scope, approach, roles, schedule, and exit criteria, this document aligns all stakeholders-developers, QA, and business representatives-around a clear, shared vision for testing.

# Objectives & Tasks

Objectives
- Verify data integrity and consistency across all workflows.
- Ensure every navigation link and button behaves as expected.
- Validate responsive design on a broad range of screen sizes and browsers.

Tasks
1. Test Design: Define detailed test scenarios and map them to requirements.
2. Functional Testing: Manually execute each scenario against the Bubble application.
3. Data Testing: Create and validate test data sets to cover typical and edge-case inputs.
4. Compatibility & Responsiveness: Test across mobile devices, screen resolutions, and browsers.
5. Performance & Load: Measure page-load times and simulate user concurrency using Lighthouse and custom scripts.
6. Defect Management & Reporting: Log issues, retest fixes, and report status at regular interals.

# Test Items
- Bubble Application Front-End: All custom pages, workflows, forms, and database interactions built in Bubble.
- APIs & Integrations: Any REST endpoints or third-party services invoked by the app (excludnig 3rd-party UI widgets).

# Features to Be Tested / Not to Be Tested

In scope:
- All Bubble-native modules and custom workflows.
- Data CRUD operations, navigation flows, form validations.
- Responsiveness and browser compatibility (Chrome, Safari, Firefox on mobile).

Out of Scope:
- Third-party widgets and plugins, assumed to be vendor-validated.
- Legacy/deprecated functionality not included in the current release.

# Approach

Test Levels: System and acceptance testing.

Test Types:
- Functional
- Compatibility
- Performance/Load

Techniques & Tools:
- Manual exploratory testing for UI and workflows.
- Boundary-value and equivalence partitioning for data inputs.
- Google Lightouse for performance metrics.
- Device emulators and real-device labs for responsiveness.

# Pass/Fail Criteria

Entry Criteria: Developer sign-off on feature completion and availability of a stable test environment.

Exit Criteria:
- \>= 95% of planned test cases executed with "Pass."
- Zero open defects of "Critical" severity.
- No outstanding "High" severity issues without approved mitigation.

# Test Environment

Devices:
- iOS (iPhone X and above)
- Android (Pixel 4 and above)

Browsers:
- Mobile Chrome
- Mobile Safari
- Firefox for Android/iOS

Network Conditions:
- Private LAN for initial smoke tests.
- Simulated public network via rented IPv4 and captive-portal tooling.

Test Data:
- Standardized user accounts and datasets covering normal and edge cases.

# Roles & Responsibilities

QA Engineer: Test design, execution, defect logging, reporting.
Developer: Provide builds, help troubleshoot environment issues.
Project Lead: Review test summaries and approve release.

# Risks & Contigencies

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Slow Bubble DB response times | Delayed performance tests | Implement caching, schedule tests during off-peak hours. |
| Limited code visibility (proprietary Bubble) | Harder to diagnose bugs | Request detailed logs and screen recordings from developer. |
| Single QA resource | Bottleneck in execution | Prioritize based on risk; consider periodic peer reviews. |

# Deliverables & Approvals

Deliverables:
- Test Plan document
- Detailed Test Case suite
- Defect reports and logs
- Final Test Summary Report

Approvals:
| Role | Name | Date |
|---|---|---|
| QA Engineer | | |
| Project Leader | | |
