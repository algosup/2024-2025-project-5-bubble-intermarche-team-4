# Introduction

The purpose of this Test Plan is to ensure that the Bubble-based application is fully functional, stable, and free of defects before delivery to the client.
By defining scope, approach, roles, schedule, and exit criteria, this document aligns all stakeholders-developers, QA, and business representatives-around a clear, shared vision for testing.

# Objectives & Tasks

Objectives
- Verify data integrity and consistency across all workflows.

Tasks
1. Test Design: Define detailed test scenarios and map them to requirements.
2. Functional Testing: Manually execute each scenario against the Bubble application.
3. Data Testing: Create and validate test data sets to cover typical and edge-case inputs.
4. Compatibility & Responsiveness: Test across mobile devices, screen resolutions, and browsers.
5. Performance & Load: Measure page-load times and simulate user concurrency using Lighthouse and custom scripts.
6. Defect Management & Reporting: Log issues, retest fixes, and report status at regular interals.
