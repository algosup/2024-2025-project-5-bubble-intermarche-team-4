## Week 2 Report (April 28â€“30)

### Summary  
The project regained structure with the return of the project manager. The team finalised the mockup and began creating a prototype in Bubble. Technical concerns were raised about Bubble, prompting discussions about a possible switch to a more efficient technology.

### Accomplishments

- The project manager resumed leadership
- First version of mockup completed
- Bubble prototype created (not yet finished)
- GitHub repository initialised
- Mural Kanban board set up
- Technical alternatives researched (Bubble vs. web app)

### Challenges

- Bubble's free plan revealed major performance limitations
- The client hasn't validated any of the work

### Status

- Functional spec work is progressing steadily
- The technology direction is still unclear without client input
- The team is aligned and productive despite external constraints

### Planned Next Week

- Enhance the prototype
- Nearly finalise the functional specs
- Try to obtain client validation to unlock development    
- Push further discussion on switching tech stack
