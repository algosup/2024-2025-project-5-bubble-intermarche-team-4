## Week 2 Report (April 28â€“30)

### Summary  
The project regained structure with the return of the project manager. The team finalised the mockup and began creating a prototype in Bubble. Technical concerns were raised about Bubble, prompting discussions about a possible switch to a more efficient technology.

### Accomplishments

- The project manager resumed leadership
- First version of mockup completed
- Bubble prototype created (not yet finished)
- GitHub repository initialised
- Mural Kanban board set up
- Technical alternatives researched (Bubble vs. web app)

### Challenges

- Bubble's free plan revealed major performance limitations
- The client hasn't validated any of the work
- Limited workdays (3 days) due to scheduling

### Status

- Work on the functional specifications is progressing steadily and is on track to be completed on time.
- The current technology direction is still unclear and poses a risk if client input is not provided before the .
- Despite these uncertainties, the team remains aligned and productive, and key deliverables are not currently delayed.

### Planned Next Week

- Enhance the prototype
- Nearly finalise the functional specifications
- Try to obtain client validation to unlock development    
- Push further discussion on switching tech stack

### Conclusion

This week marked strong organisational progress, with clearer roles and deliverables. Technical feasibility concerns around Bubble introduced some strategic uncertainty. While the timeline is still on track, client validation is urgently needed to lock in technical decisions and move forward with implementation.
