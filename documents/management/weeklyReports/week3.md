## Week 3 Report (May 5 – 7)

### Summary  
The team made strong progress in documentation, finalising most of the functional specification. The user manual skeleton was structured, and prototype improvements continued. However, the absence of client feedback created a technical and strategic bottleneck.

### Accomplishments

- Functional specifications are nearly finished
- Prototype enriched with core features and pages
- User manual skeleton completed: structure, section titles, and initial design
- Team explored refinement of technical strategy
- Ongoing coordination through the mural Kanban board

### Challenges

- No client response on mockups or specs
- Feedback delay is preventing the final validation of the functional and technical direction
- Prototype can not be finished until the platform is confirmed

### Status

- On schedule, but entering a risk zone if no feedback is received soon
- Functional specs can be delivered if feedback comes in time
- Mockups and tech stack choices remain unvalidated

### Planned Next Week

- Continue requesting client feedback
- Prepare for a potential switch in technology
- Start initial work on technical specifications
- Finalise the prototype
- Maintain the delivery timeline by completing what can be done independently

### Conclusion

The team demonstrated focus and productivity, making significant strides on documentation and the prototype. However, progress is approaching a ceiling due to the absence of client validation. Without timely feedback, technical and design work may need revisions, putting the overall schedule at risk. Next week’s success hinges on unlocking this input.
