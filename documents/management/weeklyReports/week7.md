## Week 7 Report (June 2 – 6)

## Overview

This week was centered around the second round of real-user testing at Intermarché Bourges. Feedback from the first testing session in Vierzon was used to guide initial design improvements. Although testing at Bourges was successfully conducted, its feedback will be reviewed and integrated during the following week. Additionally, the test plan was finalised and delivered on schedule.

## Accomplishments

- User testing was successfully conducted on the 6th of June at Intermarché Bourges:
  - The target audience was defined in more detail.
  - The barcode scanning functionality was tested.
  - Signage was tested for optimal visibility, including evaluation of positioning within the aisles, layout disposition, and size.
  - The team was welcomed to return at any time to conduct additional testing sessions in the store.
- Website design was reviewed and improved based on feedback collected during the first user testing session at Intermarché Vierzon.
- The test plan was completed and delivered as planned.

## Challenges

- A lack of participants from the target demographic limited the breadth of testing insights.
- The product barcode scanning feature did not function as expected during testing. A €40 fee is required to enable this functionality, which was not originally accounted for in the budget.

## Status

- The test plan was finished and delivered on time.
- The user manual remains on hold.
- The project is progressing as expected and remains on schedule, with a buffer built in to accommodate any unforeseen issues.

## Plan for Next Week

- Analyse and integrate feedback from the second user testing session (Bourges).
- Continue user testing with real users.
- Advance the development of the alternative website.
- Begin writing the user manual.

## Conclusion

Despite some budget-related constraints and limited access to the target audience, valuable progress was made through ongoing testing and early design adjustments. The team remains on track and is well-positioned to address upcoming improvements based on Bourges feedback in the following week.
