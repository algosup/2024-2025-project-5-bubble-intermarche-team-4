## Week 4 Report (May 12–16)
## Draft

### Summary  
Despite continuing uncertainty, the team maintained progress by multiplying task timelines by 3 to accommodate delays. The functional specification is completed, and technical specs have officially started. Work on the prototype was paused until direction is confirmed.

### Accomplishments

- Functional specification completed
- Technical specification work officially started
- The client responded with a meeting scheduled for Friday, 16 May, 2PM.
- Project documentation completed (timeline, code of conduct, kanban)
- Risk managed through timeline adjustments
- Plan a future meeting ahead with the client 

### Challenges

- Still no validation on mockups or functional document during the week
- Scope uncertainty caused a halt in prototype development
- Refinement of mockups is on hold pending client input

### Status

- Still on schedule thanks to adjusted planning
- Functional spec is ready, but requirements risk becoming outdated if feedback changes them
- Delivery not at risk, but content validation is

### Planned Next Week
 
- Update mockup and functional spec as needed
- Continue developing technical specs
- Resume and refine prototype development
- Start building the test plan
- Make a final decision on tech stack based on the client’s input
