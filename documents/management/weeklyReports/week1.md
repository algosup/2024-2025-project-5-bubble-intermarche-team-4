## Week 1 Report (April 22–25)

### Summary  
The project began with a joint kickoff that included all eight teams, the client, and the director. The team clarified project objectives and started shaping the user vision for the Intermarché wine and cheese recommendation app. Early work focused on brainstorming and drafting feature ideas.

### Accomplishments

- Project kickoff with all stakeholders
- Brainstorming clarified the core vision:
    - Personalised food & wine pairing
    - Promotion of regional specialities and local producers
    - User-friendly interface, no login required
    - Multilingual access to boost inclusivity
- Feature list exploration and first design ideas
- Technical feasibility research began
- Functional specification drafting initiated

### Challenges

- No project manager present early on, which slowed decision-making
- Confusion within the team about what was a requirement vs. a “nice-to-have”
- Mockups were only started — not yet completed
    
### Status

- Early-stage alignment and vision completed    

### Planned Next Week
