- Functional specs can be delivered if feedback comes in time
- Mockups and tech stack choices remain unvalidated

### Planned Next Week

- Continue requesting client feedback
- Prepare for a potential switch in technology
- Start initial work on technical specifications
- Finalise the prototype
- Maintain the delivery timeline by completing what can be done independently

### Conclusion

The team demonstrated focus and productivity, making significant strides on documentation and the prototype. However, progress is approaching a ceiling due to the absence of client validation. Without timely feedback, technical and design work may need revisions, putting the overall schedule at risk. Next week’s success hinges on unlocking this input.

## Week 4 Report (May 12 – 16)

### Overview

Despite ongoing uncertainty, steady progress was maintained by applying a 3x buffer to all task timelines to anticipate delays. The functional specification was completed and technical specification work was officially initiated. Prototype development was paused pending confirmation on the project's direction.

A meeting with the client was held on Friday, 16 May at 2 PM. During the discussion, it was agreed that the technology stack would be changed, as long as the solution remains functional. The addition of an admin side was acknowledged as part of the original scope, and design details were deprioritised.

### Accomplishments

- The functional specification was completed and delivered on time.
- Work on the technical specification was officially started.
- A client meeting was held and key decisions were confirmed regarding technology and scope.
- Project documentation (timeline, code of conduct, Kanban board) was finalized.
- Risk was managed through timeline adjustments.

### Challenges

- No validation on the mock-ups or functional document was received during the week.
- Uncertainty in the project scope led to a temporary pause in prototype development.
- Refinement of mock-ups was postponed pending feedback from the client.

### Status

- The project remains on schedule due to proactive planning and timeline buffering.
- The functional specification is ready, but its content is at risk of becoming outdated if major feedback is introduced.
- Delivery deadlines are not currently at risk, but content validation remains a key concern.

### Plan for Next Week

- Continue developing the technical specifications.
- Resume and refine prototype development based on clarified scope.
- Begin drafting the test plan.
- Make a final decision on the technology stack, based on the outcomes of the client meeting.
