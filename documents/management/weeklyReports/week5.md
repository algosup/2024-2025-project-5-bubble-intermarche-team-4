## Week 5 Report (May 19 – 23)

## Overview

This week was dedicated to advancing the technical foundation of the project and preparing for the upcoming testing phase. Two proof of concepts, one in Bubble and one using standard web technologies were largely completed, though design elements are still needing improvements. Technical specifications were finalized in structure, though a few deeper implementation details remain to be addressed.

Efforts were made to reach out to multiple Intermarché locations to arrange real-user testing. A physical testing panel was also created to support and guide the test process.

## Accomplishments

- The proof of concept was developed in both Bubble and web technologies and is currently awaiting design review.
- The technical specifications were completed, with remaining fine details to be finalized.
- Initial testing materials were produced, including the creation of a physical panel to support real-user testing.
- Multiple Intermarché stores were contacted for user testing coordination:
  - **Issoudun**: No response received.
  - **Vierzon**: A response was received; a follow-up is expected on Monday.
  - **Bourges**: Awaiting responses; follow-up emails were sent.
  - **Mehun-sur-Yèvre**: Declined participation.

## Challenges

- Some fine-grained technical elements still need to be detailed in the specification.
- A lack of response from several stores has delayed the scheduling of real-user tests.
- Team motivation remains moderate due to ongoing uncertainty and waiting periods.

## Status

- Proofs of concept are nearly complete and need design validation.
- Technical specifications are mostly complete but require refinement on a few technical aspects.
- Testing coordination has been initiated with clients but is awaiting final confirmations.

## Plan for Next Week

- Recontact the Intermarché stores that have not yet responded.
- Finalize the remaining details in the technical specifications.
- Make progress on the test plan and define specific test cases.
- Conduct initial testing with real users, if store confirmations are received.
- Continue developing the user manual, focusing on structure and basic instructions.

## Conclusion

This week brought significant advancement on both the technical and operational fronts. With most elements in place for testing and development, the focus now shifts toward final validations and real-user engagement. Once store feedback is confirmed, user testing will begin, enabling valuable insights to be gathered in the following phase.
